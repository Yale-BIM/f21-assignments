## Introduction 
This assignment will provide you practical experience with the [tf](ros.org/wiki/tf) ROS package, 
the pinhole camera model, and inverse kinematics. You will also practice
a bit of geometry, e.g., to transform points across coordinate frames.

#### System Requirements
As for the first assignment, you should have access to a computer with `Ubuntu 20.04` and `ROS Noetic` to complete the homework. 

You should also have `git` installed in the machine that you are using to work on your assignment.
You will use git to save your work to your [GitHub](http://www.github.com) repository.

Lastly, you should use Python 3 to implement all your solutions (including extra questions for CPSC-559).

#### Background Knowledge

This assignment assumes that you have already completed the [first](../assignment-1) assignment and,
thus, have set up your repository and catkin workspace. You are also expected to have experience with Linux shells 
(e.g., [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)), [git](https://git-scm.com/), and
the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://www.ros.org/). This includes being familiar with
the `roscore`, `rosrun`, `roslaunch`, `rostopic`, `rosmsg`, `rosnode`, `rqt_graph`, and `rviz` tools. You
should also know how to bring up a simulation of the Shutter robot in ROS, and
control the position of its joints one at a time. If
you are unfamiliar with any of these tools, programs, or procedures, please revisit [assignment-1](../assignment-1).

#### Deliverables

- **Report:** You are expected to submit a pdf to Gradescope with answers to the questions/tasks at 
the end of each part of the assignment. This report should also have any information needed 
to understand and/or run your code, as well as the specific commit SHA of your final version of 
the code for this assignment. The report is a fillable PDF which is available [here for CPSC 459 Students](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltrEf2Imwh04I87yDpLKiMksq4B8d-fQ/view?usp=sharing) and [here for CPSC 559 Students](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QnU1UnOc3LD7ttinGCo7rjxWu8q_P5PH/view?usp=sharing). 

    Use the latest version of [Adobe Acrobat Reader DC](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) to fill this PDF in Windows or OSX. You can get Reader DC for Windows and OSX from the [Yale Software Library](https://software.yale.edu/software/adobe-reader-dc).
    In Ubuntu 20.04, you can install Acrobat Reader DC with [wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)) by following [these instructions](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-adobe-acrobat-reader-dc-wine-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux).
    Note that you might need to install [Windows 7 fonts](https://www.w7df.com/p/windows-7.html) in Ubuntu for the Reader program to work properly (see [these instructions](https://askubuntu.com/a/1103305) to install the fonts).
    You are expected to fill out the fields in the report with your answers in text form or as images, as indicated by the PDF.

- **ROS Bag:** You are expected to provide a link to [ROS bags](http://wiki.ros.org/Bags) in your
 assignment report (see Parts III of this assignment). ROS bags can be hosted in [Google drive](https://drive.google.com) 
 or [Box](https://yale.account.box.com) -- you should ensure that the teaching staff can access your ROS bags.

- **Code:** Finally, you are expected to push code for this assignment to your 
[GitHub](http://www.github.com) repository as explained for the  
the [first assignment](https://github.com/Yale-BIM/f20-assignments/tree/master/assignment-1). You should submit your final code via Gradescope for evaluation.

#### Further Reading and Tutorials

- [tf: The Transform Library](http://wiki.ros.org/Papers/TePRA2013_Foote?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=TePRA2013_Foote.pdf)
- [Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Craig-Introduction-to-Robotics-Mechanics-and-Control-4th-Edition/PGM91709.html) by J. Craig (see Chapters 3 and 4 for more information on manipulator kinematics)

## Preliminaries

### Notation
We refer to `vectors` or column matrices with bold lower-case letters (e.g., ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bx%7D) <!--$`\bold{x}`$-->).
Other `matrices`, such as linear transformations, and `scalars` are written with regular
font weight. 

### Conventions

In this course, all reasoning in space is done in a 
[right hand system](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Right-HandRule.html). The orientation
of the cross product between ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bi%7D%20%3D%20%5B1%2C%200%2C%200%5D%5ET) <!--$`\bold{i} = [1, 0, 0]^T`$--> (in the direction of the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x) <!--$`x`$-->axis) and 
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bj%7D%20%3D%20%5B0%2C%201%2C%200%5D%5ET)<!--$`\bold{j} = [0, 1, 0]^T`$--> (![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y)<!--$`y`$--> axis) is determined by
placing ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bi%7D)<!--$`\bold{i}`$--> and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bj%7D)<!--$`\bold{j}`$--> tail-to-tail, flattening the right hand, extending it in the direction
of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bi%7D)<!--$`\bold{i}`$-->, and then curling the fingers towards ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bj%7D)<!--$`\bold{j}`$-->. The thumb then points in the direction
of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bk%7D%20%3D%20%5Cbold%7Bi%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cbold%7Bj%7D%20%3D%20%5B0%2C0%2C1%5D%5ET)<!--$`\bold{k} = \bold{i} \times \bold{j} = [0,0,1]^T`$--> (corresponding to the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z)<!--$`z`$--> axis).

</p>

We also use a [right hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule#Rotations) 
for rotations: right fingers are curled in the direction of rotation and the right thumb 
points in the positive direction of the axis.

### Kinematic Chains

A kinematic chain is an assembly of rigid bodies or `links` connected by `joints`.
The joints allow the links to move relative to one another
and are typically instrumented with sensors, e.g., to measure the relative position of neihboring links.

There are different types of joints but, in this assignment, we will focus on
working with `revolute joints` because Shutter has 4 of them. Revolute joints
have a single axis of rotation and, thus, exibit just one Degree of Freedom. The 
`joint angle` of these revolute joints controls the displacement between the pair
of links that are connected to it.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://circuitdigest.com/sites/default/files/inlineimages/Revolute-Joint.gif" width="150" alt="Revolute joint from circuitdigest.com"/><br/>
Revolute Joint (image from circuitdigest.com)
</p>

In general, we think about Degrees of Freedom (DoF) as the number of independent variables 
that need to be specified in order to locate all parts of a robot.
Shutter, has 4 servos in its arm, each of which implements a revolute joint. Thus, Shutter has 4 DoF. 


### 3D Transformations

3D spatial transformations map 3D points from one `coordinate system` (or `frame`) to another.
They are particularly relevant for robotics and 3D vision applications, where the 
elements of interest are in different locations in the world. For example, transformations
are useful to know the position of the camera in Shutter relative to one of its 
links or its base. Similarly, 3D transformations can help infer the location of an object 
with respect to a camera that observes it.

Following [ROS conventions](http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Overview/Transformations), 
we refer to a point ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bp%7D)<!--$`\mathbf{p}`$--> within a frame ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$--> as ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bp%7D)<!--$`^{B}\mathbf{p}`$-->. 
We also refer to the relationship between any two frames ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$--> and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$--> as 
a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) transformation: 
a rotation followed by a translation. Specifically,
the pose of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$--> in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$--> is given by the rotation of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$-->'s coordinate axes in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$-->
 and the translation from ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$-->'s origin to ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$-->'s origin. 

>- **Translations:** A 3D translation can be represented by a vector ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bt%7D%20%3D%20%5Bt_1%2C%20t_2%2C%20t_3%5D)<!--$`\bold{t} = [t_1, t_2, t_3]`$-->
    or by a ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204)<!--$`4 \times 4`$--> matrix:<br>
    ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20%3D%20%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%201%20%26%200%20%26%200%20%26%20t_1%5C%5C%200%20%26%201%20%26%200%20%26%20t_2%5C%5C%200%20%26%200%20%26%201%20%26%20t_3%5C%5C%200%20%26%200%20%26%200%20%26%201%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D)<!--$`t =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & t_1\\
    0 & 1 & 0 & t_2\\
    0 & 0 & 1 & t_3\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}`$--><br>
    The scalars ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t_1)<!--$`t_1`$-->, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t_2)<!--$`t_2`$-->, and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t_3)<!--$`t_3`$--> correspond to the displacements in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x)<!--$`x`$-->,
    ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y)<!--$`y`$-->, and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z)<!--$`z`$-->, respectively. Thus, a translation has 3 DoF. Note that
    representing translations with ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204)<!--$`4 \times 4`$--> matrices as above is helpful 
    for transforming points in homogeneous coordinates.<br>
>- **Rotations:** A 3D rotation has 3 DoF as well. Each DoF corresponds to a rotation around one of the axes of the 
    coordinate frame. We can represent rotations also as ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204)<!--$`4 \times 4`$--> transformation matrices:<br>
    ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%20%3D%20%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%20r_%7B11%7D%20%26%20r_%7B12%7D%20%26%20r_%7B13%7D%20%26%200%5C%5C%20r_%7B21%7D%20%26%20r_%7B22%7D%20%26%20r_%7B23%7D%20%26%200%5C%5C%20r_%7B31%7D%20%26%20r_%7B32%7D%20%26%20r_%7B33%7D%20%26%200%5C%5C%200%20%26%200%20%26%200%20%26%201%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D)
    <!--$`R = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & 0\\
    r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & 0\\
    r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}`$-->
    <br>
    Note that the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20%5Ctimes%203) <!--$`3 \times 3`$--> submatrix of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R)<!--$`R`$--> with the elements ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7B11%7D%20%5Cldots%20r_%7B33%7D) <!--$`r_{11}`$ ... $`r_{33}`$-->
    is an [orthogonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix).<br>    
    It is important to know that [ROS uses quaternions](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Quaternions) 
    to represent rotations, but there are many other useful representations (e.g., 
    [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles)).

### Changing the Frame of a Point
Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BA%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bp%7D)<!--$`^{A}\mathbf{p}`$--> be a 3D point in the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$--> frame. Its position in 
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$--> can be expressed as ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bp%7D%20%3D%20%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7DT%5C%20%5E%7BA%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bp%7D)<!--$`^{B}\mathbf{p} = ^{B}_{A}T\ ^{A}\mathbf{p}`$-->, where 
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7DT%20%3D%20%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7D%28t%20%5Ctimes%20R%29)<!--$`^{B}_{A}T = ^{B}_{A}(t \times R)`$--> is the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204)<!--$`4 \times 4`$--> transformation matrix that
results from right-multiplying the translation matrix ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7Dt)<!--$`^{B}_{A}t`$--> by the rotation
matrix ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7DR)<!--$`^{B}_{A}R`$-->. In particular,
 
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7Dt)<!--$`^{B}_{A}t`$--> is the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204)<!--$`4 \times 4`$--> transformation matrix that encodes the
 translation between the frames ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$--> and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$-->. The values ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t_1%2C%20t_2%2C%20t_3)<!--$`t_1, t_2, t_3`$--> of
the translation ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7Dt)<!--$`^{B}_{A}t`$--> are the origin of the frame ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$--> in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$-->.
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7DR)<!--$`^{B}_{A}R`$--> is the  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204)<!--$`4 \times 4`$--> rotation matrix corresponding to the orientation of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$-->'s coordinate axes in 
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$-->. 

Note that the 3D vector with elements ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7B11%7D%2C%20r_%7B21%7D%2C%20r_%7B31%7D)<!--$`r_{11}, r_{21}, r_{31}`$--> 
from the first column of the rotation matrix ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BB%7D_%7BA%7DR)<!--$`^{B}_{A}R`$--> has the same direction as the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x)<!--$`x`$--> axis of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$--> 
in the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$--> frame. Similarly, the elements ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7B12%7D%2C%20r_%7B22%7D%2C%20r_%7B32%7D)<!--$`r_{12}, r_{22}, r_{32}`$-->
and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7B13%7D%2C%20r_%7B23%7D%2C%20r_%7B33%7D)<!--$`r_{13}, r_{23}, r_{33}`$--> have the same direction of the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y)<!--$`y`$--> and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z)<!--$`z`$--> axes of 
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A)<!--$`A`$--> in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B)<!--$`B`$-->, respectively.

### Transforms in ROS

The [tf](http://wiki.ros.org/tf) library in ROS represents transforms and coordinate frames 
in a `tree structure` buffered in time. The tree is a directed graph with a root. Any two 
vertices in it are connected by one path. The nodes of the graph correspond to coordinate frames,
each associated with a link, and the edges correspond to transforms between pairs of frames. 

<p align="center">
<img src="http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Debugging%20tools?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=frames2.png" width="400" alt="Example tf tree from wiki.ros.org"/><br/>
Example tf tree (image from wiki.ros.org)
</p>

Any directed edge in the tf tree has a `parent` frame (source node), and a `child` frame 
(target node). Let the parent frame be ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P)<!--$`P`$--> and the child be ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C)<!--$`C`$-->. Then, the transform
stored in the edge parent -> child corresponds to ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BP%7D_%7BC%7DT)<!--$`^{P}_{C}T`$-->.

The tf library quickly computes the net transform between two nodes (frames) 
by multiplying the edges connecting them. To traverse up a directed edge from a child to a parent node, 
tf uses the inverse of the transformation that is stored in the edge.

## Setup
Before you start implementing or answering questions for this assignment, please update
your repository to pull the latest changes from the assignments repository and update
the shutter-ros repository:

```bash
# update your repository with the latest version of the assignment
$ cd <path-to-your-repository-in-your-workspace>
$ git pull upstream master

# update the shutter-ros repository 
$ roscd shutter_bringup
$ git pull

# finally, re-build your catkin workspace 
$ cd <path-to-your-catkin-workspace-root-directory>
$ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```


## Part I. Introduction to tf
This part of the assignment will help you understand how [tf](https://wiki.ros.org/tf2) lets 
users keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time in ROS. 

> NOTE: When this tutorial refers to `tf`,
it refers to the second version of the tf package (also known as tf2). This is important because if you look online for information about
tf, you might find information for tf (version 1) and tf2 (version 2). For a detailed list of differences between
these two versions of the library, check this [migration guide](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Migration). In general, tf2 provides the same functionality of 
tf, but is more efficient. Although tf2 has general backward compatibility, you want to avoid mixing function calls of tf and tf2 within a single ROS node -- this can break your code.

1. Complete the [Introduction to tf2](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf2)
tutorial from ROS. You should familiarize yourself with the `view_frames.py` and `tf_echo` tools from [tf2_tools](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2_tools). 
You should also learn to visualize tf transforms in with [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz).

<!--
    > If you are using the bim laptops, then `ros-melodic-turtle-tf2`, `ros-melodic-tf2-tools`, and `ros-melodic-tf` should already be installed in the computer.
-->

### Questions / Tasks
Now that you know how to use basic tf tools, bring up a simulation of the robot Shutter (as in [assignment-1](../assignment-1/README.md)). 
You will inspect its tf tree with tf tools. 

> NOTE: In [assignment-1](../assignment-1/README.md), you ran `roscore` before bringing up the robot to enable ROS nodes to communicate. 
But you can also launch `shutter_sim.launch` directly, as you did in the tutorial. 
If roscore isn't already running, roslaunch  will automatically start it. Try it!

- **I-1.** Generate an image of the tf tree of Shutter with [view_frames.py](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2_tools). 
Include this image in your report.

    > Tip: You can also generate the image with the 
    [rqt_tf_tree](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_tf_tree) interface if you prefer.

- **I-2.** Based on the tf tree from I-1, which frames are between the robot's *base_footprint* 
frame and the *camera_color_optical_frame* frame?

- **I-3.** Based on the tf tree, what is the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204)<!--$`4 \times 4`$--> transformation ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BC%7D_%7BO%7DT)<!--$`^{C}_{O}T`$-->
between the *camera_link* frame (![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C)<!--$`C`$-->) and the *camera_color_optical_frame* frame (![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O)<!--$`O`$-->)? Please
provide the transformation with both the rotation and translation components.

    > Tip 1: You can use the [tf_echo](http://wiki.ros.org/tf#tf_echo) tool to query
    transformations. You will then need to assemble the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204)<!--$`4 \times 4`$--> homogenous transformation matrix 
    from these values. We recommend [this primer](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Quaternion+and+Rotation+Primer) from Ogre
    if you are confused about different rotation representations.

    > Tip 2: We recommend that you visualize the frames of interest in RViz to ensure that the transformation that
    you are computing is in the right direction. Note that 
    ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BC%7D_%7BO%7DT) is not the same as
    ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7BO%7D_%7BC%7DT).


- **I-4.** How are the transformations in the /tf and /tf_static topics generated after you 
bring up the robot? Please explain which node(s) contribute to generating the tf tree.

    > Tip: You should inspect what nodes and topics are being published in your ROS system,
    e.g., with the [rqt_graph](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph) tool. You can also read the shutter_sim.launch script
    in the shutter_bringup package (and any subsequent script that it launches) 
    to understand how the robot's tf tree is being generated.


## Part II. Publishing tf messages
As mentioned earlier, the [tf](https://wiki.ros.org/tf2) library
uses a tree structure to represent frames and transformations in ROS. These frames and transformations
are created based on the messages streamed through the /tf and /tf_static topics. 

By convention, the /tf and /tf_static topics 
transmit messages of the type [tf2_msgs/TFMessage](http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/tf2_msgs/html/msg/TFMessage.html). In turn, these messages
 contain a list of transformations encoded as 
[geometry_msgs/TransformStamped](http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html) messages.
Each [geometry_msgs/TransformStamped](http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html) 
message has:

- a `header`, with a `stamp` of when the transform was published 
and the `frame_id` of the parent frame for the transformation;
- a `child_frame_id`, corresponding to the name of the child frame; and
- a `transform`, of type [geometry_msgs/Transform](http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Transform.html),
with the translation and rotation of the transform ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B%5Ctext%7Bparent%7D%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7Bchild%7D%7DT)<!--<sup>parent</sup><sub>child</sub>$`T`$-->.

You will use code that is already provided in this assignment to learn how to publish tf
data as described above. To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Inspect the `generate_target.py` Python script in the `scripts` directory of the `shutter_lookat` 
package that is provided as part of this assignment. You should understand how the script creates a 
simulated moving object and publishes its position relative to the "base_footprint" frame of 
Shutter through the `/target` topic.

2. Visualize the moving target in [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz). Before running the launch
script below, make sure that you are not running any other node in ROS.

    ```bash
    $ roslaunch shutter_lookat generate_target.launch
    ```

    The launch script should then open RViz and display the robot and the moving target in front
    of it. The target should be displayed as a red ball.
    
    
    > [Roslaunch](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch) is a tool for easily launching multiple
    ROS nodes. Roslaunch scripts are written in XML format, according to [this specification](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML).

   

### Questions / Tasks
Let's now publish the position of the moving object as a ROS tf frame.

- **II-1.** Follow the steps below to make a new ROS node that publishes 
the position of a simulated moving object as a ROS tf frame ("target") relative
to the robot's "camera_color_optical_frame" frame. 

    - Create a new ROS node in Python within the `scripts` directory of the `shutter_lookat` package.
The node should be named `publish_target_relative_to_realsense_camera.py`. The python script should have executable permissions.

    - Within your new node:
    
        - Subscribe to the `/target` topic to receive the position of the
simulated object relative to the "base_footprint" frame.

            > Tip: We suggest that you organize the code of your node
in a Python class, as in [this tutorial on a pytalker node](http://wiki.ros.org/ROSNodeTutorialPython#The_pytalker_node),
given the increased complexity of this node in comparison previous examples. For Ubuntu 20.04, make sure to use 
`#!/usr/bin/env python3` instead of `#!/usr/bin/env python` to define your node as a Python executable, as Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic are meant to work with Python 3.

        - Transform the 3D pose of the moving object to the "camera_color_optical_frame" frame in Shutter.
        For this, you will have to query the transformation between the "base_footprint" frame in which the target pose is provided
        and the "camera_color_optical_frame" using the `lookup_transform` function from the tf2 API. 
        Make sure to query the transformation at the time when the target pose was computed.

            > Tip 1: You can take a look at this ROS tutorial on [writing a tf2 listener](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20listener%20%28Python%29)
            for some examples on using the tf2 API.
             
            > Tip 2: You can use the [tf2_geometry_msgs](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2_geometry_msgs) API to transform the pose of the object
            as in [this post](https://answers.ros.org/question/222306/transform-a-pose-to-another-frame-with-tf2-in-python/).
            
        - Broadcast a tf transform between the "camera_color_optical_frame" frame (parent) and a new "target" frame (child) in tf. 
        The target frame should match the pose of the simulated object in the camera_color_optical_frame.
        
            > Tip: An example on broadcasting tf transformations can be found in 
            [this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20broadcaster%20%28Python%29).
        
    - Close all your nodes in ROS, launch the `generate_target.launch` script, and launch your new node which publishes
    the `target` frame. 
    
    - Add a TF display to RViz, and verify that the new `target` frame that you are publishing
    visually matches the position of the moving target (red ball). If the frame and the moving
    object are not displayed in the same place, check your code and edit as necessary.
    
    - Run public tests for this part of this assignment to ensure that your node is operating as expected:
    
        ```bash
        $ rostest shutter_lookat_public_tests test_publish_target.launch
        ```
      
        If you want to see how the tests are implemented, check the `shutter_lookat_public_tests` package that is 
        provided as part of this assignment. More specifically, the tests for Part II are implemented in 
        `shutter_lookat_public_tests/test/test_publish_target.py`.
    
    - Save your work by adding and committing your publish_target_relative_to_realsense_camera.py
    script to your local repository. Push your code to GitHub.
     
        > Remember that continously committing your work and pushing to GitHub will ensure that your
        code is backed up and readily accessible in the future.
    
- **II-2.**  Stop any ROS processes that you are running, relaunch the 
    generate_target.launch script, run your `publish_target_relative_to_realsense_camera.py` node, and create a 
    new image of the tf tree in ROS, e.g., using [view_frames.py](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2_tools) or [rqt_tf_tree](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_tf_tree). 
    Add the image of the tf tree to your report.
    
    
## Part III. Making a virtual camera
Assume that the moving object from Part II of this assignment is a sphere. Now, you will 
work on projecting the simulated object on a virtual image captured from Shutter. Close all ROS nodes before
starting this part of the assignment.

1. Inspect the `virtual_camera.py` node that is provided as part of this assignment within the `shutter_lookat/scripts`
directory.  

2. Complete the `project_3D_point()` function at the top of the script. This function receives the coordinates of a 
3D point with coordinates x, y, z in the camera frame and computes the projected location for this point onto the image
using the camera's intrinsic matrix K.

3. Complete the `draw_image()` function at the top of the script. This function receives the coordinates of a 
3D point in the camera frame and renders an image with a circle representing the projected location of the point onto the image
plane.

    a. The `draw_image()` function should first create an empty image using the [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/). 
    The image should have white background and dimensions of width x height pixels. An example on how you can create an image 
    with opencv is provided below:
    
    ```python
    # Example code
    import cv2          # import opencv
    import numpy as np  # import numpy
    
    # create image
    image = np.zeros((height, width, 3), np.uint8) # width and height are the dimensions of the image
    # color image
    image[:,:] = (255,255,255) # (B, G, R)
    ```
   
    b. The `draw_image()` function should then compute the projected location for the 3D target onto the image.
    To this end, the `draw_image()` function should call the `project_3D_point()` function, passing the 3D coordinates
    and intrinsic camera matrix K.
    
    c. The `draw_image()` function should draw the outline of a red circle on the image. 
    The position of the center of the circle should match the position of the projected 3D point in the image. Make
    the radius of the circle 12 pixels, and its outline 3 pixels wide.
    
    ```python
    # Example code
    cv2.circle(image, (x,y), radius, (0,0,255), outline_width) # (x,y) is the projected location of the target on the image
    ```
    
    > Tip: See the official [OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/dc/da5/tutorial_py_drawing_functions.html) 
    for more examples on drawing basic figures.

    d. The `draw_image()` function should return the image with the drawn circle.

4. Edit the `__init__()` function of the `virtual_camera.py` node to define an instance variable K of type numpy array. 
This array should correspond to the 3x3 intrinsic camera matrix of your virtual camera. In particular, it should be defined 
based on the following parameters:

    ```python
    cx=320       # x-coordinate of principal point in terms of pixel dimensions
    cy=240       # y-coordinate of principal point in terms of pixel dimensions
    fx=349       # focal length in terms of pixel dimensions in the x direction
    fy=349       # focal length in terms of pixel dimensions in the y direction
    # note: assume there's no skew.
    ```
   
    > Tip: If you are unsure of what the above parameters mean, read more about projective cameras 
    in Hartly & Zisserman's [Multiple View Geometry](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/hzbook/) book.

5. Edit the `target_callback()` function in the `virtual_camera.py` node such that it repeats the steps below every time 
a new message from the /target topic is received. 

    **a.** Compute the target's pose in the "camera_color_optical_frame" frame (as in Part II of this assignment).

    **b.** Call the `draw_image()` function to create a virtual camera image that shows the projected location of the target
    as a circle. The resulting image should have dimensions of 640 x 480 pixels.
   
    **c.** Publishes the image that you created with OpenCV as a [sensor_msgs/Image](http://docs.ros.org/noetic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html) message in ROS. You
    can use the [cv_bridge](http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge) library to convert the OpenCV image to
    an Image message. Note that the Image message should have a `header` with the current time as
    `stamp` and the "camera_color_optical_frame" frame as `frame_id`. The Image message should be published by your node
    through the `/virtual_camera/image_raw` topic.
    
    > Tip: Examples on converting OpenCV images to ROS messages can be found
    in [this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge/Tutorials/ConvertingBetweenROSImagesAndOpenCVImagesPython).
    
6. Visualize the images that your node is publishing using the 
[rqt_image_view](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_image_view) tool. You should see the red circle
moving in a circular path in the image (as in the Figure below). If this is not the case, please check your implementation of the
virtual_camera.py script.

### Questions / Tasks

- **III-1.** Explain in your report what is the difference between calling the `lookup_transform`
function from the tf2 API with the time of the target's pose, rospy.Time(0), or rospy.Time.now() as third argument?

    > Note: How you call the lookup_transform function can have an effect on the
    rate of operation of your virtual_camera.py node and how often it can publish images. 
    You can use the [rostopic hz](http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic) tool to check how fast messages are published by a node.
    
- **III-2.** Edit your virtual_camera.py script to enable your node to also publish 
 calibration parameters. Sharing the parameters will help other programs 
 reason geometrically about the images that your virtual camera generates. Note that the parameters should be published as a [CameraInfo](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CameraInfo.html) message through the `/virtual_camera/camera_info` topic, as indicated in the steps below.

    **a.** Import the [CameraInfo](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CameraInfo.html) message
    into your virtual_camera.py script.
    
    ```python
    # Example
    from sensor_msgs.msg import CameraInfo
    ```
    
    **b.** Create a function that builds CameraInfo messages from the calibration parameters
    provided in Part III of this assignment. You can use the code snippet below to this end.
    
    ```python
    def make_camera_info_message(stamp, frame_id, image_width, image_height, cx, cy, fx, fy):
        """
        Build CameraInfo message
        :param stamp: timestamp for the message
        :param frame_id: frame id of the camera
        :param image_width: image width
        :param image_height: image height
        :param cx: x-coordinate of principal point in terms of pixel dimensions
        :param cy: y-coordinate of principal point in terms of pixel dimensions
        :param fx: focal length in terms of pixel dimensions in the x direction
        :param fy: focal length in terms of pixel dimensions in the y direction
        :return: CameraInfo message with the camera calibration parameters.
        """
        camera_info_msg = CameraInfo()
        camera_info_msg.header.stamp = stamp
        camera_info_msg.header.frame_id = frame_id
        camera_info_msg.width = image_width
        camera_info_msg.height = image_height
        camera_info_msg.K = [fx, 0, cx, 0, fy, cy, 0, 0, 1]
        camera_info_msg.D = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        camera_info_msg.R = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
        camera_info_msg.P = [fx, 0, cx, 0, 0, fy, cy, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
        camera_info_msg.distortion_model = "plumb_bob"
        return camera_info_msg
    ```
    
    > Note: Specific details about the fields of CameraInfo messages can be found 
     in its [message definition](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CameraInfo.html).
    
    **c.** Create a publisher for the CameraInfo messages in your node.
    
    ```python
    # Example
    camerainfo_pub = rospy.Publisher("/virtual_camera/camera_info", CameraInfo, queue_size=10)
    ```
    
    **d.** Publish a CameraInfo message whenever your node publishes an Image message. The
    CameraInfo message should have the same header as the Image message.
    
    ```python
    # Example (assumes that image_msg is the Image message that your node publishes for the virtual camera)
    camerainfo_msg = make_camera_info_message(image_msg.header.stamp,
                                              image_msg.header.frame_id,
                                              image_width,
                                              image_height,
                                              cx, cy,
                                              fx, fy)
    camerainfo_pub.publish(camerainfo_msg)
    ```

    > Note: If the code of your node was organized into a class structure, then you could create the camerainfo_msg
    message when a class instance is initialized and save it as a member of the instance for future use. When the images are then created, you
    would just need to copy the header of the image message into the pre-computed camerainfo_msg, and publish it. While in practice
    organizing the code this way won't make your program in this part of the assignment much faster given the speed of computers today, thinking about ways 
    to optimize the operation of your ROS nodes so that the same computation is not repeated over and over unnecessarily is important for real-time systems.
    
    **e.** Finally, check that your node is publishing CameraInfo messages through the 
    /virtual_camera/camera_info topic with the [rostopic echo](http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic#rostopic_echo) tool.

    > Remember to commit your code whenever you want to save a snapshot of your work. 

- **III-3.** You will now verify that the image and the camera parameters that your node publishes 
are consistent with one another with the help of the RViz [Camera Plugin](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Camera). 

    > The [Camera Plugin](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Camera) creates a new rendering
window in RViz from the perspective of a camera using the CameraInfo message that your virtual_camera.py node publishes. 
The plugin also lets you overlay other displays that you have enabled in RViz on the rendered image. Your goal is to use these overlays to verify that
the virtual camera that you already implemented is working correctly. 

    Close all running ROS nodes and re-launch the generate_target.launch script. Then run 
    your virtual_camera.py node and, once RViz opens, add a Camera display to the RViz window.
    Configure the camera plugin as follows:
    
        Image Topic: /virtual_camera/image_raw
        Transport Hint: raw
        Image Rendering: background
        Overlay Alpha: 0.6
        Zoom Factor: 1

    The red circle from your /virtual_camera/image_raw image should then align in the RViz 
    Camera plugin with the red ball of the simulated moving object (as in the Figure below). 
    If this is not the case, check and correct your implementation of the virtual_camera.py node.
       
    <p align="center">
    <kbd>
    <img src="docs/rviz_camera.png" width="300"/>
    </kbd>
    </p>

    > Tip: If parts of the robot are displayed in the camera plugin image, then you can remove them by temporarily disabling the RobotModel plugin in Rviz.
    
    Once the image that is published by the virtual_camera.py script is consistent 
    with what the Camera plugin shows in RViz, record a ROS [bag](http://wiki.ros.org/Bags) 
    as in [this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Tutorials/Recording%20and%20playing%20back%20data). 
    The bag should have all of the messages that are streamed in your system for a duration of 8 seconds.
    
    ```bash
    $ rosbag record -O <your-name>_a3p3-3.bag -a --duration 8 
    ```
    
    > You can see a description of the arguments that `rosbag record` accepts [here](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline#record). Make sure to start 
    the generate_target.launch file and your virtual camera before starting to record the bag, or the bag might end up being empty!
    
    Inspect your ROS bag with the [rosbag info](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline#rosbag_info) tool to verify that it contains messages
    for all of the following topics:
        
        * /diagnostics
        * /joint_states 
        * /rosout   
        * /target  
        * /target_marker 
        * /tf         
        * /tf_static  
        * /virtual_camera/camera_info    
        * /virtual_camera/image_raw 
    
    Upload your ROS bag to Google Drive or Box and <u>make it accessible to anybody with the link</u>. Then, 
    **provide a link to your ROS bag in your report** for this assignment. You don't need to and 
    you shouldn't commit the bag to your repository! Otherwise, you will make your repository
    unnecessarily heavy.

- **III-4.** Explain in your report what happens with the projection of the target on the image
when the target is behind the camera? How and why is the image changed? To visualize this result, you
can launch the `generate_target.launch` script with the optional parameter `target_x_plane:=<x>`, where \<x\> corresponds to the target's
x coordinate on the robot's "base_footprint" frame. Then inspect the images that your node generates.

- **III-5.** Your virtual camera could see behind it, but real cameras don't do that. Modify the `draw_image()` function 
in the virtual_camera.py node so that the part of your code that computes the projection of the target and draws the circle only 
executes if the target is in front of the camera. That is, these parts of your program should only execute if the Z component of 
the target's position in the camera coordinate frame is positive. If the Z component is zero or negative, the function 
should instead return an empty (white) image. In the latter case, the function should also print a warning message:

    ```python
    # example warning
    rospy.logwarn("Warning: Target is behind the camera (z={})".format(z)) # z is the z coordinate for the target's center point relative to the camera frame
    ```
    
Run public tests for Part III of this assignment to ensure that your node is operating as expected:

 ```bash
 $ rostest shutter_lookat_public_tests test_virtual_camera.launch
 ```

Note that the above tests will run automatically in Gradescope when you submit your code to the 
`Assignment 2 - Code` assignment.

## Part IV. Making a fancier virtual camera
You will now modify your virtual_camera.py node so that instead of drawing a circle with a fixed radius for the target, 
it draws the true outline of the spherical target as seen by the camera. 

1. Copy your virtual_camera.py script into a new script called `fancy_virtual_camera.py`. The new script
should be located within the `shutter_lookat/scripts` directory. It should have executable permissions.

2. Change the name of the new node in the `rospy.init_node()` function to `fancy_virtual_camera`
and edit any other relevant documentation in your code to indicate that the program implements a fancier virtual camera for 
Shutter.

### Questions / Tasks

Solve the questions below and complete the corresponding programming tasks on your `fancy_virtual_camera.py` node 
such that it outputs better images of the target for your camera. In brief, you will need to modify the `draw_image()` function in the new node 
such that it computes a direction vector ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbold%7Bq%27%7D)<!--$`\bold{q'}`$--> 
from the center of the 3D target to the edge of the sphere seen by the camera. Then, you will be able to draw the target's 
true shape by rotating the vector along a rotation axis in the direction of the target, and projecting the resulting 
3D points along the edge of the sphere onto the camera image.

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/diagram_a3.png" width="500"/>

- **IV-1.** To get started, let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bt%7D%20%3D%20%5Bt_x%5C%20t_y%5C%20t_z%5D%5ET)<!--$`\bold{t} = [t_x\ t_y\ t_z]^T`$--> be the vector from the camera center to the center of the target 
in the camera coordinate frame (as shown in the image above). 
Additionally, let the camera coordinate frame be oriented such that the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bz%7D)<!--$`\bold{z}`$--> axis points
forward. How can you mathematically calculate a vector ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bq%7D)<!--$`\bold{q}`$--> perpendicular to both ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bt%7D)<!--$`\bold{t}`$--> and the horizontal axis ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bx%7D)<!--$`\bold{x}`$--> of the
camera coordinate frame? Explain in your report.

- **IV-2.**  Now that you have computed a vector perpendicular to the direction towards the target (as seen by the camera), 
how can you scale this vector to have a length equal to the radius ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R)<!--$`R`$--> of the moving 3D sphere? Provide the equation that scales ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bq%7D)<!--$`\bold{q}`$--> as desired while
preserving its direction in your report.

- **IV-3.**  Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bq%27%7D)<!--$`\bold{q'}`$--> be the scaled vector 
from question IV-2. Explain mathematically in your report how can rotate this vector by an 
angle ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha)<!--$`\alpha`$--> along a normalized rotation axis aligned 
with the vector ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bt%7D)<!--$`\bold{t}`$--> from question IV-1.

    > Tip. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation) is a convenient place to learn more about the axis-angle parameterization of rotations.

- **IV-4.**  Points along the edge of the sphere (as seen by the camera), can now be computed as: 
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbold%7Bt%7D%20&plus;%20rotate%28%5Cbold%7Bq%27%7D%2C%20%5Calpha%29), <!--$`\bold{t} + rotate(\bold{q'}, \alpha)`$-->
where `rotate()` is a function that implements IV-3. Modify the `draw_image()` function in your new 
`fancy_virtual_camera.py` script to compute 20 3D points equally distributed along the edge of the sphere that is 
seen by the camera. The code that computes these points should replace the prior computation for the red circle from Part III
in your new `fancy_virtual_camera.py` script.

    Note that the radius of the sphere in the world is provided through the /target message (see the `radius` field). You
    should pass this value from the target callback to the `draw_image()` function using the optional keyworded arguments `kwargs`.
    More specifically, you should pass the value using the `radius` keyword: `draw_image(x, y, z, K, width, height, radius=target_msg.radius)`.
    
    > Tip: If you are not familiar with keyworded variable length arguments in Python, check [this guide](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/args_and_kwargs.html).
    
    Use the code below when you implement these changes to `draw_image()`. In particular, add the functions at the top level 
    of the fancy virtual camera script - that is, outside any other class or function. When you submit your assignment, 
    automated tests will check that the functions are working as expected for your evaluation.

   ```python
   def compute_q(pt, radius):
       """
       Compute q - a vector perpindicular to the target
       direction and the horizontal axis of the camera
       coordinate frame.
       pt: the point at the center of the sphere in the
           camera coordinate frame
       radius: the radius of the ball 
       """
       # add your implementation here
       q = np.array([0.,0.,0.])
       return q
   ```
   
   ```python
   def compute_rotation_axis(pt):
       """
       Compute normalized rotation axis in same direction
       as vector t from question IV-1.
       pt: the point at the center of the sphere in the
           camera coordinate frame
       """
       # add your implementation here
       rotation_axis = np.array([0.,0.,0.])
       return rotation_axis
   ```
   
   ```python
   def rotate_q(q, rotation_axis, angle):
       """
       Rotate q around rotation_axis by the number of 
       radians specified by angle.
       q: perpindicular vector from IV-1 and IV-2
       rotation_axis: normalized rotation axis from IV-3
       angle: angle of rotation in radians
       """
       # add your implementation here
       rotated_q = np.array([0.,0.,0.])
       return rotated_q
   ```
   
   You can run public tests for this part of this assignment to ensure that your node is operating as expected:

     ```bash
     $ rostest shutter_lookat_public_tests test_fancy_virtual_camera.launch
     ```

- **IV-5.**  Add a few lines of code to the `draw_image()` function such that it draws a blue contour for the sphere on the image using OpenCV. The contour should connect the projected points on the image:

    ```python
    # Example
    pixel_array = np.zeros((N,2), dtype=np.int32) # N is the number of points on the contour
    (...) # compute the points as in IV-4
    cv2.drawContours(image, [pixel_array], 0, (255,0,0), 3)
    ```

    The resulting image should now show the blue polygon (and no red circle), as shown below:
    
    <p align="center">
    <kbd>
    <img src="docs/ball_outline.png" width="300"/>
    </kbd>
    </p>

- **IV-6.**  Restart ROS and re-run the generate_target.launch with the ball updating at a lower speed, and being closer to the camera:
    
    ```bash
    $ roslaunch shutter_lookat generate_target.launch target_x_plane:=0.5 publish_rate:=1 # the publish rate for the target is in Hz
    ```
    
    Then restart your `fancy_virtual_camera.py` node and take a picture of your resulting camera image when the target is nearby one of the corners of the image. 
    The image should show the target being elongated; not having a perfectly circular shape anymore. Include this image in your report and explain why the target does not
    appear to be a perfect circle, especially towards the edge of the image.
