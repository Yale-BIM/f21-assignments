# CPSC-459/559 Fall 2021. Assignments

Assignment repository for Yale's [CPSC-459/559 Building Interactive Machines](https://cpsc459-bim.gitlab.io/f21/) (Fall 2021).

## General Instructions

To get started with a given assignment, see the README.md file within the assignment directory. 

For Assignments 1-4, it is essential that you have completed the set up instructions in the [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) file that is included in this repository. The instructions explain how to setup a GitHub repository and the general procedure that should be followed by students when working on course assignments.

Assignment 1 will guide you through installing ROS and setting up your workspace in Ubuntu 20.04. You need this operating system to work with assignments in general. If you are a regular user of mac or windows, consider using a virtual machine to run Ubuntu in your computer. For example, this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBXXn-xKbIwEGBNnfd7w0aOTEN0yPPg0VPKYyB2gHZM/edit?usp=sharing) explains how you can setup a virtual machine with Ubuntu using VirtualBox.

## Honor Code

Programming assignments are your individual responsibility, and plagiarism will not be tolerated. You are encouraged to discuss assignments with the instructor and 
with the teaching staff. <u>If you discuss assignment problems with other students, you should indicate this explicitly in your assignment report.</u> Note that even in the latter case, you are required to implement and write any assignment on your own. Students should not copy, nor allow their work to be copied.
